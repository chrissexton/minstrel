A Google VertexAI client for their Bard language completion service in Go.

## Setup

You will need a GCP project set up with VertexAI permissions. Install
the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/?hl=en_US) and run `gcloud auth print-access-token` to get a token.

You can demo all of this
on [the VertexAI prompt builder](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/language/create/chat)

## Usage

You can find an interactive usage example in the `examples` directory.

## Is it good?

It's going to do what I need. Probably not what you need.
